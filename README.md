# CTR
Config TRanslator

This program is designed to translate configuration files for Minecraft plugins, as well as translate files in general. It automatically detects placeholders (values enclosed in %) and supports preserving text between specific characters. It utilizes a free translation library from Google for text translation. Python allows for easy extension and maintenance of the program. The translation is available in any language worldwide! In the future, the project plans to add a graphical user interface for user convenience.
